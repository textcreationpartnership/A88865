            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here being a rumour that the Apprentiſes of <hi>Norwich</hi> would pull downe the Rayles of the great Church, (<hi>Chriſts-Church</hi> they call it) but there is but a little of Chriſt taught, and leſſe practiſed. But as I ſaid, there was a talke that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſes of <hi>Norwich</hi> would pull downe the Rayles, and the Organs; therefore there was forthwith a Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on called, wherein was debated by the<note n="*" place="margin">Unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſo ſay the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Deane and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whether or no the Rayles ſhould be pulled downe; and the Convocation of Deane and Prebends thought fit that the Rayles ſhould bee pull'd downe, for feare leaſt when the Apprentiſes came, Organs and all ſhould goe to wracke; therefore it was thus ordered.</p>
            <p>That the Rayles ſhould be pull'd downe, and ſo they were, but the Organs ſtood ſtill: The Apprentiſes of <hi>Norwich</hi> not being content with that, they threatned to have a bout with the Organs, upon Shrove-tueſday that was ſuddenly after to follow, but had no ſuch intent, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to skarre the fooles.</p>
            <p>The Cathedrall Blades upon this did forthwith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide great ſtore of Parſons and Prieſts,<note n="*" place="margin">There was about 500.</note> to be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt that day, to reſiſt the rebellious Puritans, as they term'd them; the matter was no ſooner propounded, but it was preſently put in agitation, and the gates of the great Cathedrall were ſhut for two dayes. Shrove tueſday being come, they began to put themſelves into a poſture of defence, at the command of the Convocation of the Deane and Prebends of the Cathedrall Church, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

Firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there was the Prebenders in order ſet, and to give their grave adviſe, they were preſent to helpe at a pinch, when there was no need of them, nor their counſell: I think it had been better for their commendations to have beene at their ſtudies, to prepare themſelves to preach this Lent, but I beleeve their Sermons were not then to get <hi>extempore,</hi> for they cannot preach a Sermon unleſſe their bookes be before them, which is Doctor-like for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, and therefore a ſhort warning might ſerve their turnes; for ſome of them cannot, and the reſt will not preach <hi>extempore,</hi> but muſt be mute like aſſes; or elſe do as a Prieſt that I heard of did, when hee had forgot his booke, he told them he would reade a chapter of <hi>Iob,</hi> that ſhould bee worth two of his Sermons, and I thinke it would be worth twenty of our Prieſts Sermons: thus they ſtood then.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place there were in order ſet the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I meane the ſinging-men, and they were ready to helpe at a pinch if need be, they muſt blow the Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as they termed them, with their profound ſounding roaring voyces: They ſtood centinell in their Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call coats, a body would thinke they ſhould have beene at their Engliſh maſſe, to call to the Pope for a Bull, to roare againſt the Apprentiſes, and to have conjured the Rebels away, as they doe in the Letany: me-thinks this, if any thing might have done good, but alas, they were ſo afraid that they could not pray that day, and if they did, it was but faintly, for they had done their Engliſh ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-maſſe that day, before they uſe to begin at other times: thus all day they ſtood centinell to keep the Pipes, when there was no body had any intent to pull them downe.</p>
            <p>There was thirdly the Quiriſters,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> who are much like to the other, but of a lower degree, who gave their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156542:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 22 -->one of which ſaid, that he had beene to doe his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: that is, he had been at ſinging Service, that they there uſe, and now ſayes he, I am come to doe my duty to keep the Organs; and there he, with the reſt, ſtood like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of fooles, to keepe them from danger, which none that I doe know, had any minde to hurt.</p>
            <p>And ſayes<note n="*" place="margin">His name is <hi>Atkins.</hi>
               </note> another, what rogues are theſe that dare offer to pull downe the Organs; for ſayes he, if I doe but goe into Church and ſay my prayers, and heare the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans goe, they make the water runne downe my cheeks, they are ſo good and ſo ſweet a muſick. Thus good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou maiſt ſee how theſe men are rock'd and lull'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep by this muſicke, which have indeed lull'd many one aſleep in ignorance. There is one <hi>Trew</hi> that is a conſtant hearer of this muſicall Maſſe; and he ſaith, that he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth great comfort by it, how will he doe when it be put downe? as I hope it will ere long: Thus are many lull'd aſleep in Romiſh ignorance, (as the Papiſts ſay) the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of devotion, which is I thinke all the devotion that many (if not all of them) uſe; and theſe are the effects that the Pipes produce.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place there were the Muſquetiers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ready charged with bullets; and<note n="*" place="margin">His name was <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Trew.</hi>
               </note> one of them had in his Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket a bullet ſplit in parts for to ſhoot the Apprentiſes when they come (ſay they:) Thus they ſtood all the day long ſhooting, and threatning the Rebels that dare come to pull downe their Organs, when as the Apprentiſes had no intent to come, but were at home about their maſters occaſions; and did not intend to foule their fingers about ſuch a company of rake-ſhames: and thus they ſtood like ſo many Abraham Ninnies, doing nothing but tell how many Crowes flew over the pinacle.</p>
            <p>And in the fift place there was the Holbardiers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they kept centinell, expecting to runne their Holbards in any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156542:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 23 -->bodies belly that dare offer to come and commit any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury againſt the Pipes: they did examine every body that came to Church, and not ſo much as a little boy ſhould paſſe, but that they would know whether he were any of thoſe that did intend to pull downe the Organs: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that one being taken, was carried before their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Deame, and be examining him, the man told the Deane, that the Rayles, and Pipes, and other Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, was againſt the Proteſtation; and he had ſworne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Innovations, and he would pull them downe where-ever he ſaw them, for ſo he was bound to doe by the Proteſtation that he had taken. The Deane hearing theſe and many other words come brom him, he bade him goe his way, he was a Puritan, he would not meddle with him; and I pray what was the reaſon, becauſe he had no power: I beleeve his will was good, had he had power as well as deſire, he would have put him to puniſhment enough. And another fooliſh fellow they tooke, (take notice that be was an Idiot) and ſent to the Juſtices, and ſo hee was ſent to Bridewell, but they were glad to take him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; had he had wit enough, he might have made his accuſers ſmart for it. It ſeemes he had a minde to goe into Church, (as a many fooles had beſides he) and they would not let him goe; and ſaid bee would come 400 ſtrong and pull downe their Pipes, and upon this they ſent him to Bridewell: thus the Holbard-men ſtood in a poſture of defence to carry this fellow to Bridewell, and ſo one foole carried another.</p>
            <p>And in the ſixth and laſt place there was about the number of 500 perſons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> armed with ſwords and piſtolls, and other weapons, to bee upon the bratts of any that ſhould come againſt their Pipes; they watcht and warded with a pot and a pipe under their noſes, while ſome of them were as fort as beggars; inſomuch as one <hi>Trew</hi> by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156542:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 23 -->name, (though not by nature) ſaid, if 500 come we will kill 2000 of them; and to that end he ſaid, come fellow Souldiers we will ſlay them all, and ſo he pull'd out his piſtoll, and ſaid hee would kill one if hee could: I have ſuch a good opinion of him, that I thinke the foole had more wit than to thinke that 200 of 500 could be ſlaine; but he was drunke, and this 2000 was the reaſon of his ſo fooliſh a ſpeech; he and others were ſo intoxicated with ſtrong Ale that was to be ſould at the great Cathedrall, that they could not tell what they ſaid or did. Thus good Reader, thou maiſt ſee the folly of theſe Pipe-mongers, that ſhould prepare ſuch a multitude of people, to bee there a whole day for nothing.</p>
            <p>If the Deane and Prebends had been ſtudying, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniers a ſinging, the Quiriſters a chanting, the Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers about their callings, the Holbardiers about their buſineſſe, and their piſtoll-blades about their occaſions, it had been a little better for their praiſe; for now I hope by this ſmall paper their fooliſhneſſe ſhall be divulged to the uttermoſt parts of this Kingdome, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may laugh at the ſillyneſſe of the Cathedrall Blades, and the Epiſcopall Abettors. Oh how loath they are to part with their Diana's, their Altars, Images, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes, Coapes, Surplices, and Romiſh Veſtments; no, (as ſome of them ſaid) they would rather loſe their lives then their Organs, ſo faſt they are glewed to their Pipes and Popiſh trinkets.</p>
            <p>It is a ſaying as true as ancient, that there is nothing ſo bad, but ſome good may be gotten from it; no flower ſo bad, but that the Bee will get ſome honey from it: ſo not ſo much but from this fooliſh practiſe, and ſimple tractate, there may be ſome good got.</p>
